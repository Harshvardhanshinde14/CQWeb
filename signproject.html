                    <h2>Dedicated Freight Corridor</h2>
                    <p>Be it connectivity, decongestion of current routes, or raising the speed of hefty hauling trains, a dedicated freight corridor is a game changer in the country's economic development.
                    The Western DFC (1506 Route km) and Eastern DFC (1506 Route km) are being built by the Dedicated Freight Corridor Corporation of India .
                        The Eastern Corridor - EDFC will run from Sahnewal near Ludhiana (Punjab) to Dankuni in West Bengal, passing through the states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Jharkhand.
                        The Western Corridor - WDFC, which will run from Dadri in Uttar Pradesh to Mumbai's Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT), will pass through the WDFC states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Maharashtra.
                        D.F.C. is a famous project in India, and we are proud to have delivered software for it.</p>

                        The expressway is yet another signature project that shines bright in our portfolio . This Expressway will enable a large population to have easy access to major centers in Maharashtra for a wide range of self-employment and wage employment opportunities, business, trade, education, health care and other necessary services.
                        The expressway will pass through ten districts, namely Nagpur, Wardha, Amravati, Washim, Buldhana, Aurangabad, Jalna, Ahmednagar, Nashik and Thane. It will connect Nagpur to Mumbai and have direct connectivity with the country’s largest container port – JNPT.
                        This will enhance EXIM (export-import) trade of the state. Inter-connecting highways and feeder roads would be constructed to connect all important cities and tourist places along this route.
                        This will connect another fourteen districts, namely Chandrapur, Bhandara, Gondia, Gadchiroli, Yavatmal, Akola, Hingoli, Parbhani, Nanded, Beed, Dhule, Jalgaon, Palghar and Raigad. In this manner, a total of twenty-four districts in Maharashtra will be connected via this expressway.
                        Major tourist destinations in the state will also be connected to the expressway. </p>
